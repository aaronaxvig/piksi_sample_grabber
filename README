sample_grabber : receives an arbitrary number of raw samples from the Piksi,
                 using the onboard FT232H in FIFO mode

back_to_uart : configures the FT232H EEPROM for VCP mode for normal operation,
               to be used after running sample_grabber or if the EEPROM is 
               blank/corrupted
