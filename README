sample_grabber : Receives an arbitrary number of raw samples from the Piksi,
                 using the onboard FT232H in FIFO mode

set_fifo_mode : Writes settings to EEPROM attached to FT232H for synchronous
                FIFO mode in order to stream raw samples from the RF frontend
                through the FPGA. Must be used before running sample_grabber.

set_uart_mode : Erases EEPROM attached to FT232H to set the FT232H in UART mode
                for normal operation. Should be used after running 
                sample_grabber.

Building : to build the programs run "make"

Dependencies : sample_grabber needs libftdi v1.0.
                   http://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/download.php
               set_uart_mode and set_fifo_mode need the D2XX drivers from FTDI.
