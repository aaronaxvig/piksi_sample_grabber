sample_grabber : Receives an arbitrary number of raw samples from the Piksi,
                 using the onboard FT232H in FIFO mode. The FT232H on the Piksi
                 must be set in FIFO mode before sample_grabber can be used -
                 run set_fifo_mode to do this. After finishing using
                 sample_grabber, use set_uart_mode to set the FT232H on the
                 Piksi in UART mode for normal operation.

set_fifo_mode : Writes settings to EEPROM attached to FT232H for synchronous
                FIFO mode in order to stream raw samples from the RF frontend
                through the FPGA. Must be used before running sample_grabber.

set_uart_mode : Erases EEPROM attached to FT232H to set the FT232H in UART mode
                for normal operation. Should be used after running
                sample_grabber.

Building : to build the programs run "make"

Dependencies : libftdi1 : for sample_grabber
                   http://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/download.php
                   libftdi1 has the following dependencies:
                       libusb1.0
                       linconfuse
                   We recommend installing these from source from the link.
